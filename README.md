Obstacle-Detecting Sensor Car
This project showcases an autonomous car that uses IR sensors to detect obstacles and navigate around them. 

Features
Obstacle Detection: Uses IR sensors to detect objects in the carâ€™s path.
Autonomous Navigation: Changes direction automatically when an obstacle is detected.

Components
Arduino (Uno/Nano)
IR sensor(s) (for obstacle detection)
Motor driver module (e.g., L298N)
12V DC motors
Power supply (Battery pack)
Chassis for mounting components
